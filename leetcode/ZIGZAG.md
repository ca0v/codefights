# Zigzag Conversion

INPUT: PAYPALLISHIRING, 3
OUTPUT: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR

Because the input is converted into three rows using the following pattern:

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

If we change the input to this:

INPUT: 0123456789, 3
OUTPUT: 0481357926

```
0   4   8
1 3 5 7 9
2   6
```

I assume ever even column has only one character but which row does it print into?
The question is unclear so I will not work on this.
